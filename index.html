		  <h3>The Problem.<hr></h3>
		  <p>More than 18 thousand people were killed due to gun violence this year¹.</p>
		  <p>And more than half of those were in schools and stores². Along with that, many PTSD³ cases were due to shootings. We plan to change that. </p>
          <p>When cars were popularized in the early 1900s, they were believed to be death traps. But, many universities and companies invested in crash-tests and many other safety mechanism. These days, cars are extremely safe. We believe we can make guns safer like cars were made safer almost half a century ago.</p>

        <h3>Past solutions⁵<hr></h3>
        <p> • <b>Personalized guns.</b> Guns that only work with the owner's fingerprint. <i>The problem: Too expensive </i> </p>
        <p> • <b>Locked guns.</b> Guns that cannot be used while locked. <i>The problem: The locks are easy to remove & too hard to put on once taken off</i> </p>
		<p> • <b>Child-proof guns.</b> Guns that 'can not be used by a normal child under 8' to limit accidental injuries. <i> The problem: It works, but it's too niche</i></p>

        <h3>The solution.<hr></h3>
         <p> <b> A device that institutions/companies set up that emit an electromagnetic radiation signal. </b></p>
         <p>Newer guns'll have a blocker installed on them. If the gun senses the radiation, that blocker will get enabled and the gun wont shoot. For example, outside a Wal-Mart™₄ (or inside) there'll be a device that emits electromagnetic radiation. So, if a shooter enters, they wont be able to use their guns. This can also be set-up in schools and provided by the government for no cost for select buildings. </p>
         <p>Of course, police and military guns would be exempt to this</p>

             <h3>Implementation.<hr></h3>
         <p>California is already suggesting the US' biggest gun buyback. If we get a few more states, or even the central government to chip in then all the older guns will be bought and replaced with this new version. There will be a few stray guns here and there but its mostly going to be eliminated</p>

		 <h3>FAQ<hr></h3>
		  <p><b>What if people manually remove these blockers?</b></p>
          <p> True, but the same thing can be said for car safety. Someone can manually remove all of the safety and go crash into someone. Like I said, it definitely isn't perfect, but its better than what we have. Along with that, kids won't be able to remove these blockers so that would mostly eliminate school shootings by kids. </p>
          <p><b>What if someone steals a police gun?</b></p>
          <p> Many states are already suggesting the solution of having 'Personalized guns' for cops. These guns will only operate with the cop's fingerprint.</p>
          <p><i>Of course, this system isn't perfect, but it's a huge step ahead of what we have now</i></p>

		 <h3>Reflection<hr></h3>
		  <p><i>Why is our idea not implemented right now?</i></p>
		<p>1) The problem was never resolved with this approach or method</p>
        <p>2) It might be difficult to convince the government to give in (But we're ready to try!)</p>
