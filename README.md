# The Problem

More than 18 thousand people were killed due to gun violence this year.

And more than half of those were in schools and stores. Along with that, many PTSD cases were due to shootings. We plan to change that.

When cars were popularized in the early 1900s, they were believed to be death traps. But, many universities and companies invested in crash-tests and many other safety mechanism. These days, cars are extremely safe. We believe we can make guns safer like cars were made safer almost half a century ago.

# Past solutions
• Personalized guns. Guns that only work with the owner's fingerprint. The problem: Too expensive

• Locked guns. Guns that cannot be used while locked. The problem: The locks are easy to remove & too hard to put on once taken off

• Child-proof guns. Guns that 'can not be used by a normal child under 8' to limit accidental injuries. The problem: It works, but it's too niche

# The solution.

A device that institutions/companies set up that emit an electromagnetic radiation signal.

Newer guns'll have a blocker installed on them. If the gun senses the radiation, that blocker will get enabled and the gun wont shoot. For example, outside a Wal-Mart™ (or inside) there'll be a device that emits electromagnetic radiation. So, if a shooter enters, they wont be able to use their guns. This can also be set-up in schools and provided by the government for no cost for select buildings.

Of course, police and military guns would be exempt to this

#Implementation.

California is already suggesting the US' biggest gun buyback. If we get a few more states, or even the central government to chip in then all the older guns will be bought and replaced with this new version. There will be a few stray guns here and there but its mostly going to be eliminated
